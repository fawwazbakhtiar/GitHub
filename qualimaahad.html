            <h3>Maahad Tahfiz <span>Al-Fateh</span></h3>

            <h1><span>"Hafiz </span>at The <br>Age of<span> 15."</span></h1>

            <p>Maahad Tahfiz Al-Fateh, located on Jalan Kebun, Shah Alam, was the first place
            for me to start my journey of seeking knowledge at the secondary level. Fun fact, 
            I only attended primary school until I was 11 years old and started entering Tahfiz 
            when I turned 12. When I was in Tahfiz, I successfully completed the Quran and became 
            a Hafiz at the age of 15. Indirectly, that became my last year at the Tahfiz. Life in 
            the dormitory was not as beautiful as imagined, but the bittersweet memories created 
            back then remain until today.
            <br>
            <br>
            At this stage, there are various things that have shaped me into who I am today. 
            Undeniably, life in Tahfiz has made me a disciplined, responsible, time-conscious, 
            and respectful person. In my personal opinion, I have never regretted entering 
            Tahfiz because it has taught me many things that I might not have learned elsewhere.</p>
