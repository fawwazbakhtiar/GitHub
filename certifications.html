            <h1><span>"Best STPM</span> Student<br><span> Award 2025."</span></h1>

            <p>In 2024, I was awarded the Best STPM Student in 2024 with a CGPA of 3.50. This award is given annually to students who achieve an overall pointer of 3.00 and above for the entire STPM examination. The award was presented by the school principal at the excellence award ceremony held in the main hall of Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Presint 5(1) Putrajaya. Approximately 10 students received this award that year.

            The certificate awarded is very meaningful to me because it is proof of the hard work and struggle I put in during my one and a half years at that school. This award was achieved after I managed to obtain an A- grade in General Studies, a B+ in Economics, an A in Business, and a B in Malay Language. This certificate has become the best certificate I received that year.</p>

            <h3>"Semester 1<span> Best<br> Student</span> Award."</h3>
            <p>In my first semester at STPM, I was awarded the Best Semester 1 Student with a CGPA of 3.25. This award is given annually to students who achieve an overall pointer of 3.00 and above for the first semester examination. The award was presented by the school principal at the excellence award ceremony held in the auditorium of Masjid Putra, Putrajaya. Approximately 7 students received this award on that semester.
            <br>
            <br>    
            The certificate awarded is very meaningful to me because it is proof of the hard work and struggle I put in during my first semester at STPM. The first year was not an easy year for me because there were many things I had to adjust to in a new place. However, thanks to my efforts, I was still able to endure it even though it was difficult to achieve. This award was achieved after I managed to obtain an B grade in General Studies, a B in Economics, an B+ in Business, and a B+ in Malay Language.</p>
