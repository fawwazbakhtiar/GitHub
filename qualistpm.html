            <p>I came to Form 6 not for any other reason but to continue my studies to the Degree level more quickly. Studies at the STPM level only take one and a half years, and that was one of the reasons why I was there at that time. I realize this is the only opportunity I have to continue my studies to the Degree level, and therefore, I am determined to do better than before this time.
            <br>
            <br>
            Graduating from the STPM level after one and a half years, I successfully achieved an overall pointer of 3.50 with all subjects passing without fail. This achievement also placed me among the top 4 STPM students in the school that year. Unexpectedly, a student who did not come from an academic background managed to achieve excellent results in STPM. There are no words to express other than gratitude and thanks to everyone who prayed for me. And because of this, my new story begun at the Degree level as a student majoring in Information Systems Management at UiTM Puncak Perdana.</p>
